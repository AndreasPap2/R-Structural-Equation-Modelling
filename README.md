# R-Structural-Equation-Modelling


SEM: In this project after days of brainstorming and the use of Structural Equations, I tried to answer the following question: "What is the impact of the human values on institutional trust in Baltic countries and are there any differences between these countries?".

**Project in R using Structural Equations**

Following the end of Sovietization in the Baltic States and their induction in the European Union happened a lot of cultural and political parameters changed. Although most implementations of the Western European states have been implemented, patterns of political patronage persist (Gudzinskas, 2017).

This topic in previous studies have shown that among other post-communist democracies the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have low levels of institutional trust.

This project will address the following question: “What is the impact of the human values on institutional trust in Baltic countries and are there any differences between these countries?” with the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

The study uses the survey data of the European Social Survey (ESS) round 9. Although there are a lot of countries available this paper will focus on the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) as previously mentioned. The survey is partly repetitive on individuals aged 15 and over. We opted not to use the whole set of variables as offered by ESS but instead we only included a subset which is presented in table 1. The sample size for each country is: Estonia with 1904 observations , Lithuania with 1835 observations and Latvia with 918 observations, hence the total dataset consists of 4657 observations. Observations with refusal to reply or “Don’t know” as an answer will be omitted.
